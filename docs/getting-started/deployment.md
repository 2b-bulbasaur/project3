# Deployment Guide

## Vercel
We recommend using Vercel for deployment.
The free tier is sufficient for our purposes and setup is dead simple.

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy with default settings

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel
```
